TODO
====

   * Make sure new stuff is optional in the build, to be able to keep it small.
   * Fix level, so that it actually increases.
   * Fix speed, so that it increases with each level.
   * Fix pause, does not work that well.  Try getting a cup of coffee, for instance.
   * Add simple high score saving to file, default /var/games/tetris.scores
   * Option to disable high score from build, if set points to the save directory.
